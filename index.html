    Here's a little about me:
</p>
<p>
    A few of the things I enjoy doing and studying:
    <ul id="xxx">
        
        <li> <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/"style="color:81DC56">Space exploration</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220200/Kerbal_Space_Program/"style="color:81DC56">Rocketry</a><small> (that one might be a stretch)</small> , and Astrophysics (exploring and learning about our universe)</li>
        <li>Scientific history (Knowing about our past is vital for moving foward!)</li>
        <li>Engineering and design (I like to think of stuff and make it happen)</li>
        <li>Reading books ("The person who won't read has no advantage over the one who can't read." -Mark Twain)</li>
        <li>Video games (of course!)</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Space, machines, and everything.</h2>
<p>
    For all of my life, I have always had a facination with large, complex, things. It started with a love
    for railroads and trains. there was just something about them that was alluring, probably the enormous
    power of the locomotives, or seeing all those moving parts do their thing with perfect harmony. but it 
    did not last forever. soon, I learned of the atomic world. A microscopic world made of infinitesimaly small
    peices that all fit together in different ways. this is certainly what sparred my interest in atomic reactions
    and processes that I still find facinating today. These interest satisfied my curiosity for a while, but 
    something even greater was coming. SPACE!! The final frontier! It was only natural that my facination with the
    complex and mysterious would eventually lead me to the most intricate system of all time, the wider universe.
    It was almost like something clicked, something that said "This is it. This is the thing I have to be a part of."
    From that day onward, I can't get enough knowledge of space. This attachment to space soon led me to begin my 
    learning journey in the field of physics, specificaly what makes the universe tick (at least on a basic scale).

<p class="important notimportant">
  
    as soon as I learned that things could be put together to make something greater, I started doing just that. Legos, 
    tinker-toys, Sticks and rocks, sandcastles, pillow forts, whatever I could get my hands on, I could make something out of.
    Soon I started taking apart things too, such as windup cars, small clocks, and old electronics I found. the electronic
    items presented an interesting problem, however. how do they work? there were no obvious moving parts, spare items
    such as power switches.
